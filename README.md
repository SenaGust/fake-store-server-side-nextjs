This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Project idea

- we should avoid client requests, we should prioritize always server side requests
- it should be a mobile first website
- that is the figma link: [Marketplace Community from Rocketseat](https://www.figma.com/design/HfERVSfkkc1AEeZRGbN0CR/Marketplace--Community-?node-id=3-376&p=f&t=PmBnsO4kcw4nvqms-0)
- We have two options to use as a fake store api:

  -- https://dummyjson.com/
